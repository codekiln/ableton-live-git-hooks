# ableton-live-git-hooks
Hooks for storing Ableton Live `.als` and `.alc` files in git

### Project Overview
- [Repository Structure](ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/Repo___Directory___Structure.md) - Detailed overview of the repository organization
- [Installation Guide](ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/Installation.md) - Setup instructions and Git hooks configuration

### Viewing Documentation
The [ableton-live-git-hooks-docs](ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/About.md) is written in Logseq-flavored markdown (LFM) and can be viewed in two ways:

1. **Using Logseq (Recommended)**
   - Install [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
   - Open the `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs` directory as a local graph
     - See [logseq/docs: How to create a new graph](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/how%20to%20create%20a%20new%20graph)
     - when you open Logseq, select the option to add a new graph point it at the `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs` folder
   - This provides the best experience with full LFM support

2. **Using Other Markdown Viewers**
   - The documentation can be viewed in any markdown viewer
   - Note that some LFM features may not render correctly
   - GitHub's markdown viewer provides a good fallback experience, though it will not facilitate linking between pages in the knowledge base

### Key Features
- [Ableton Live Set Management](ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/Ableton___Live___Git.md) - Tools for version controlling `.als` and `.alc` files
- [Git Hooks](ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/Git___Hooks.md) - Automated workflows for `.als` â†” `.als.xml` conversion
