				- I still think I need more help from the BA (Alex) with brainstorming before continuing with the project requirements document, because the CLI is still not clear to me now that I've noticed this problem with the design. I want to brainstorm a bit on CLI UX with respect to `ableton-live-git-hooks`. The problem is that I plan to use git hooks for the process of converting `.als` and `.alc` files, but we don't want to stage binary `.als` and `.alc` files. At the same time, the user (who likely needs to be comfortable with git in order to use the tool at all), and any git user will expect to stage files and then commit them with a message.
				- At the same time, I don't have much time for this project and I want its footprint to be as small as possible. It's  more important to me that it be a minimal, simple feature set than that it be the best possible thing it could be.
				- What about something like requiring the user to enter any paths they want tracked in the yml as globs, using [[Python/Library/lefthook/Configuration/lefthook.yml]] ([Configuration - Lefthook Documentation](https://lefthook.dev/configuration/)) to supply globbed arguments to alhook? it could default to having something like this, where exclude would override include. NOTE: I'm not that familiar with lefthook yet so I'm completely making this up, but something like:
					- ```yml
					  pre-commit:
					    commands:
					      save-ableton:
					        run: alhook save
					          include_paths: 
					            - **/*.als
					            - **/*.alc
					          exclude_paths:
					            - **/Backup/*
					            - **/Ableton Project Info/*
					  ```
					- Let's say, for example, that this was a valid lefthook.yml (IT IS NOT; see [[Python/Library/lefthook/Configuration/run]] docs at [run - Lefthook Documentation](https://lefthook.dev/configuration/run.html)), then the exclude paths would override the include paths.
					- Then how would a user even initiate the first save so that it got git committed? In the first time, it wouldn't even trigger the pre-commit, because no files would be staged! That's the CLI UX problem here.
				- Maybe we could have the expectation that any time a user wanted to add a new file, they would need to run `alhook save`, which would check to see if there were any new [[Ableton/File/.als]] or [[Ableton/File/.alc]] files. Then if there were, it would ask the user interactively to confirm any that weren't found.
				- Or perhaps we'd have two separate commands, `alhook track` which would expand to XML and then stage any files that have changed or any new files meeting the glob.
				- Given that the above isn't actually valid in lefthook, it might actually make sense to have TWO configuration files - one for lefthook, and one for alhook. The `alhook.yml` could have
					- ```yml
					  include_paths: 
					    - **/*.als
					    - **/*.alc
					  exclude_paths:
					    - **/Backup/*
					    - **/Ableton Project Info/*
					  ```
				- Then the `lefthook.yml` could just have:
					- ```yml
					  # lefthook.yml
					  
					  pre-commit:
					    commands:
					      save-als:
					        files: git ls-files -m
					        glob: "*.als"
					        run: alhook save {files}
					      save-alc:
					        files: git ls-files -m
					        glob: "*.alc"
					        run: alhook save {files}
					  ```
				- There might be even more elegant ways to do this if we made a hard assumption of using lefthook. For example, taking a look at the docs for [[Python/Library/lefthook/Configuration/run]], I see they have an `{all_files} template`
					- ```yml
					  # lefthook.yml
					  
					  pre-commit:
					    commands:
					      rubocop:
					        tags:
					          - backend
					          - style
					        glob: "*.rb"
					        exclude:
					          - config/application.rb
					          - config/routes.rb
					        run: bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion {all_files}
					  ```
						- Perhaps something adapted from this could be used to achieve the same desired effect without introducing a new config file.
				- So, please review the docs for lefthook with respect to configuration at the intersection of these use cases and help me brainstorm options for a minimal, simple configuration that would achieve the effect of 1.) checking [[Ableton/File/.alc]] and [[Ableton/File/.als]] files (and potentially any other ableton live files that have the same quality of just being gzipped XML), even if they aren't git staged, and 2.) being able to help the user not get confused about what was going on, given they may be WAY more comfortable as a musician than as a developer.
			- ## [[AI/Response]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- ## 1. “Track → Save” Two-Step CLI
				  
				  **Idea:**
				- **`alhook track`**:
					- Scans for any new or modified `.als` / `.alc` files (using your include/exclude globs).
					- Presents an interactive list, “I see 3 new Ableton files—save sidecars for these? [Y/n each]”
					- Updates an internal “tracked files” list.
				- **`alhook save [--all|<paths…>]`**:
					- For each tracked or explicitly passed file, regenerates the `.xml` sidecar.
					- **Automatically** runs `git add <file>.xml`.
					- Prints “Staged: song1.als.xml, drumloop.alc.xml.”
					  
					  **Pros:**
				- Clear separation: you “track” new binaries once, then repeatedly “save” and stage.
				- Users don’t accidentally stage binaries—they only ever interact with XML.
				  
				  **Cons:**
				- Two commands to learn.
				- You’ll need to persist the tracked-files list (in `.alhook/` or `alhook.yml`).
				  
				  ---
				- ## 2. Single “Save” Command + Lefthook Globs
				  
				  **Idea:**
				- **`alhook save [<paths…>]`** does everything: scans for changed `.als`/`.alc`, regenerates XML, and stages.
				- Lefthook’s `run:` can be configured with `{all_files}` to pass in staged files, but since binaries aren’t staged, instead we explicitly invoke a save–and–stage step before the real commit.
				  
				  **Example `lefthook.yml` fragment:**
				  
				  ```
				  yaml
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  pre-commit:
				  commands:
				    ableton-save:
				      run: alhook save {all_files}
				      # using Lefthook’s {all_files} template, though here it'll be empty
				  ```
				  
				  **Workflow:**
				- User edits `song.als`.
				- Runs `git add` (no `.als` picked up).
				- Runs `git commit` → Lefthook fires `alhook save {all_files}` → finds changed `.als`, regenerates & stages XML → Lefthook aborts original commit (non-zero exit), prompting user to re-run `git commit`.
				- User re-issues `git commit`, now with the `.xml` sidecars included.
				  
				  **Pros:**
				- Single “save” command, buried in standard Git commit flow.
				- Leverages Lefthook’s own templates—no separate config file.
				  
				  **Cons:**
				- Slight friction: commit fails first time, user has to re-run it.
				- Need to signal clearly “hook ran, please re-commit”.
				  
				  ---
				- ## 3. Git Attributes Filter Driver
				  
				  **Idea:**
				  
				  Use Git’s clean/smudge filters so that users literally **stage** `.als` files, but Git internally converts them to XML and stages that:
				  
				  ```
				  gitattributes
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  *.als filter=ableton
				  ```
				  
				  And in `.git/config`:
				  
				  ```
				  ini
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  [filter "ableton"]
				  clean = alhook export --xml
				  smudge = alhook import --binary
				  ```
				  
				  **Pros:**
				- Completely transparent Git UX: users `git add song.als` and Git stages the sidecar XML.
				- No multiple commands; no commit-failure loops.
				  
				  **Cons:**
				- More complex initial setup (smudge/clean filters can be tricky across OSes).
				- Harder to debug if filters misfire.
				  
				  ---
				- ## 4. Auto-Append to  `lefthook.yml`  + Default Globs
				  
				  **Idea:**
				  
				  Ship an `alhook.yml` alongside `lefthook.yml`, containing simple path globs:
				  
				  ```
				  yaml
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  # alhook.yml
				  include_paths:
				  - "**/*.als"
				  - "**/*.alc"
				  exclude_paths:
				  - "**/Backup/**"
				  ```
				  
				  Then your `alhook install` (or first `alhook save`) will:
				- Read globs from `alhook.yml`.
				- Seed `lefthook.yml` with a matching command block, e.g.:
				  
				  ```
				  yaml
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  pre-commit:
				  commands:
				    save-ableton:
				      glob: "*.als"
				      run: alhook save {matched_files}
				  ```
				  
				  **Pros:**
				- Users edit one `alhook.yml` if they want custom globs.
				- Lefthook remains “pure,” but its config is generated for them.
				  
				  **Cons:**
				- Two files to understand (`alhook.yml` + `lefthook.yml`).
				  
				  ---
				- ### Minimal MVP Recommendation
				  
				  Given your need for simplicity and small footprint, I’d lean toward **Option 2**:
				- **MVP CLI**: implement `alhook save [paths...]` that:
					- Scans for changed `.als`/`.alc`, regenerates XML, stages XML.
					- Returns a non-zero code with “Staged X files, please re-run `git commit`” so the user immediately re-tries commit (standard Git hook pattern).
				- **MVP Lefthook**: a tiny `pre-commit` command in `lefthook.yml`:
				  
				  ```
				  yaml
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  pre-commit:
				  commands:
				    ableton-save:
				      run: alhook save
				  ```
				  
				  No separate config file, no two-step flows—users keep using `git commit`, get their XML sidecars automatically staged, and they just re-commit.

				- I want to know more about option 3 - Git Attributes Filter Driver - I've never worked with git "clean/smudge" filters, nor am I familiar with that terminology. I imagine that explaining how it works to users could be a problem, as well.
				- What would the full "CLI UX" be for using this option? Also why are they tricky across OSs? How exactly do they work?
			- ### [[AI/Response]]
				- ## How Git Clean/Smudge Filters Work
				- **.gitattributes Mapping**
				  
				  You declare that any time Git “cleans” or “smudges” a file matching a pattern, it should run an external program. For example, in your repo’s `.gitattributes`:
				  
				  ```
				  gitattributes
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  *.als filter=ableton
				  *.alc filter=ableton
				  ```
				  
				  This says: for `.als` and `.alc` files, use the “ableton” filter.
				- **Filter Configuration in .git/config**
				  
				  You then tell Git what “ableton” means:
				  
				  ```
				  ini
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  [filter "ableton"]
				  clean  = alhook export --xml
				  smudge = alhook import --binary
				  ```
					- **clean** runs when you `git add` (or commit): it takes the file’s **working-directory content** (the binary `.als`), pipes it through `alhook export --xml`, and that output is what Git actually stores in the index (and hence in your `.git` history).
					- **smudge** runs when you `git checkout` (or clone): it takes what’s in Git (the XML sidecar), pipes it through `alhook import --binary`, and writes the resulting binary `.als` into your working directory.
				- **Result**
					- The repository never holds the large binary—it holds the XML.
					- Every time you check out a commit, Git transparently rebuilds the binary `.als` files so your Ableton project loads normally.
					- When you modify the binary in your working tree and add it, Git “cleans” it back to XML for storage.
					  
					  ---
				- ## End-to-End CLI UX
				- **Setup (once per project)**
				  
				  ```
				  bash
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  git clone <repo>
				  cd repo
				  pip install ableton-live-git-hooks lefthook    # or however users install
				  alhook install-filter                            # new command to scaffold attributes & config
				  ```
				  
				  Under the hood, `alhook install-filter` would:
					- Append these lines to `.gitattributes`:
					  
					  ```
					  gitattributes
					  
					  CopyEdit
					  
					  *.als filter=ableton
					  *.alc filter=ableton
					  ```
					- Write the filter settings into `.git/config` (or update a `[filter "ableton"]` block there).
				- **Normal Workflow**
					- **Modify:** You open `song.als` in Ableton, make edits, and save.
					- **Stage & Commit:**
					  
					  ```
					  bash
					  
					  CopyEdit
					  
					  git add song.als      # triggers clean → XML stored
					  git commit -m "Edit song structure"
					  ```
					  
					  Git runs `alhook export --xml`, so it stores `song.als.xml` under the hood.
					- **Review History:**
					  
					  ```
					  bash
					  
					  CopyEdit
					  
					  git log -p -- song.als.xml
					  ```
					  
					  You see diffs in the XML—readable change history.
				- **Cloning or Checking Out Older Versions**
				  
				  ```
				  bash
				  
				  CopyEdit
				  
				  git clone <repo>
				  # .als files get smudged automatically:
				  # filters run alhook import --binary on each XML to produce binaries
				  ```
				  
				  You can open the project in Ableton immediately.
				  
				  ---
				- ## Why Filters Can Be Tricky Across OSes
				- **Shell Invocation & Paths:**
					- On Windows, Git’s “clean”/“smudge” commands run inside a minimal shell (`sh.exe` bundled with Git), not PowerShell or `cmd.exe`. If your `alhook` script has Windows-style shebangs or relies on environment-specific executables, it may break.
				- **Line-Ending Normalization:**
					- Git’s autocrlf settings can corrupt binary data if filters aren’t marked as `binary`. You must ensure attributes include `-text` or `binary` flags so Git doesn’t convert line endings.
				- **Performance:**
					- On large projects, every `git add` or `git checkout` will invoke your filter. On slower filesystems (especially network or Windows NTFS), this can feel sluggish.
				- **Config Scope:**
					- Filters configured in `.git/config` are not versioned—each developer must run `alhook install-filter` locally. Forgetting this step leads to unexplained files being stored in XML or binary inconsistencies.
				- **Cross-Platform Executables:**
					- You need to ensure `alhook` is on each user’s `PATH` and that the script is executable (`chmod +x`) on macOS/Linux—Windows users might need to rename `alhook.exe` or adjust PATHEXT settings.
					  
					  ---
				- ### Key Trade-Offs
				- **Pros:**
					- Completely transparent: users continue using `git add`/`git commit` without learning new commands.
					- Your repo remains small (XML only) and you get full binary reconstruction.
				- **Cons:**
					- Harder initial setup and onboarding: users must run the filter-installer and understand `.gitattributes`.
					- Subtle OS and Git config pitfalls that lead to corruption or confusing behavior.
					  
					  ---
					  
					  **Next Steps:**
				- If you like this approach, we can sketch out the exact implementation for `alhook install-filter`, including what it writes to `.gitattributes` and `.git/config`.
				- Alternatively, we can pick a more straightforward CLI-only flow (e.g., Option 2) to minimize OS-specific risks.
		- ## turn 3
			- ### [[AI/Query/From Me]]
				- I'd like to try using this approach. In practice, I'm trying to solve my own problem and I doubt I'll get other users anytime soon, so the main platform is just the same one I'm developing on (macOS).
				- Please prepare a project briefing about CLI UX of alhook now as we discussed git clean smudge filter workflow, and include an overview of how the installation of the gitattributes will relate sequentially or chronologically with what must happen chronologically, and be sure to account for the need to verify alhook is available as an executable to git, while taking into account that it is a HARD requirement that this work just as well in an IDE as on the command line, and one of the historical issues I had which led to this project was a case where the git executable in VSCode couldn't find the right python environment.

		- ## turn 2
			- ### [[AI/Query/From Me]]
				- After drafting the above, I think that the current project name, `ableton-live-git-hooks`, is likely sub-optimal. Instead, I think I should probably rename the project - and the CLI - to `algit`, short for "Ableton Live Git," at least, if it is available in pypi. That said, it's a bit early to do a refactor based on this hypothetical method of using git with ableton.
				- Ok, after the work the Analyst and I did above, I think that the current project name, `ableton-live-git-hooks`, is likely sub-optimal. Instead, I think I should probably rename the project - and the CLI - to `algit`, short for "Ableton Live Git," at least, if it is available in pypi. That said, it's a bit early to do a refactor based on this hypothetical method of using git with ableton. So, we need to Correct Course - review and realign existing artifacts. That said, I don't think we ever finished the earlier PRD. So please update the PRD to merge in what the Analyst and I discovered, but assume that we are going to call the cli `algit`, and while we may end up using git hooks, it's probably most likely not going to use hooks at all, but instead just a custom git-oriented ableton live CLI that implements items for git filter with custom clean and smudge.
