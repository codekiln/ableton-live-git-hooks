	  collapsed:: true
		- ### 1. Concept, Problem & Goals
			- **Core Concept:** How would you describe the core value proposition of ableton-live-git-hooks in one sentence?
				- > ableton-live-git-hooks lefts you quickly set up a repo to properly version Ableton Live files in git.
			- **Primary Problem:** What specific pain point(s) does it solve for Ableton Live project developers?
				- > Ableton Live users are musicians, not developers. They may not be familiar with ableton live's internals or git. This helps them version their projects properly.
			- **Top Goals:** Beyond "simplify hook installation," are there any secondary goals (e.g., analytics, hook customization UX)?
				- > Eventually, the CLI-based project should also guide the users to best practices with using git with ableton live, offering to set up the repository for git lfs configured for sound files, and perhaps scaffolding the repo itself in an opinionated way for users not as familiar with python.
		- ### 2. Target Users
			- **User Personas:** Who will install and run these hooks—solo musicians, production teams, plugin developers?
				- > primarily solo musicians, particularly those who have some knowledge of git
			- **Skill Level:** What's their expected comfort level with CLI tools, Git, and YAML?
				- > probably okay on these tools
			- **Environment:** Are your clients primarily on macOS, Windows, Linux, or a mix?
				- > A mix, macOS support first though
		- ### 3. MVP Scope
			- **Essential Hooks:** We've agreed on `pre-commit` and `post-checkout`—anything else truly critical for launch?
				- > It needs to be able to be installable into pyproject.toml at a basic level.
				- > Ideally the CLI should also be available via pipx or uvx for users that don't want to install a python environment just to utilize the hooks. In this case, we need some brainstorming for how to support them. That doesn't need to be part of the initial release, though.
			- **Configuration:** Will MVP support only the default `lefthook.yml` template, or must users override via CLI flags?
				- > MVP will only support the default template
			- **Customization:** Do you need an interactive "wizard" for config, or is a file scaffold sufficient?
				- > a file scaffold is sufficient
		- ### 4. Post-MVP Scope (Future Enhancements)
			- **Additional Hooks:** Which Git hooks might you add down the line (e.g., `pre-push`, `post-merge`)?
				- > I can't think of any at this time, but it's possible that once we add support for workflows with [[git/lfs]] that pre-push may have a hook.
			- **Hook Logic Plugins:** Any plans for plugin architectures, so users can drop in custom scripts?
				- > Not at this time.
			- **Analytics & Reporting:** Would gathering usage telemetry or hook success/failure stats be valuable?
				- > No
		- ### 5. Platform & Technology Preferences
			- **Language & Packaging:** We're using Python and Poetry/pip—any considerations for alternative packaging (npm, Homebrew taps)?
				- > We're using Python, uv, mise. It will be packaged on pypi.
			- **CLI Framework:** Are you open to using Click, Typer, or stick with `argparse`?
				- > for now let's keep it simple with `argparse`.
			- **YAML Management:** Would you prefer to embed Jinja2 templating in your scaffolded YAML, or keep it plain?
				- > let's keep it plain.
		- ### 6. Initial Architectural Preferences
			- > *Not a final decision—just capturing early thoughts under "Known Technical Constraints or Preferences".*
			- **Repository Style:** Monorepo (package + docs + examples together) or polyrepo (separate repos for library vs. example consumer)?
				- > Let's use a monorepo for now.
			- **Service Architecture:** If this grows into a web-based dashboard or service, would you lean monolith or microservices?
				- > This has nothing to do with web-based anything.
			- **CI/CD Integration:** Do you have a preferred CI system (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI) that should shape how hooks are tested or installed?
				- > GitHub Actions.
