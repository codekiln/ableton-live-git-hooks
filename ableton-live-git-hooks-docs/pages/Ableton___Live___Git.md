# Ableton Live Git Integration
	- ## Overview
		- This project includes tools for version controlling Ableton Live Set files (`.als` and `.alc`) by converting them to human-readable XML
		- The system automatically converts binary files to XML before commits and back to binary after checkout
		- See [[Repo/Directory/Structure]] for details on the implementation
	- ## Basic Usage
		- ### Converting Individual Files
			- TBD
		- ### Converting Multiple Files
			- TBD
	- ## Git Hooks
		- ### Pre-commit Hook
			- Automatically converts staged `.als` and `.alc` files to XML
			- Only processes files that are actually staged for commit
			- See [[Installation]] for setup instructions
		- ### Post-checkout Hook
			- Automatically rebuilds binary files from XML after checkout
			- Ensures working `.als` and `.alc` files are available for Ableton Live
	- ## Directory Structure
		- Binary files (`.als`, `.alc`) and their XML twins (`.als.xml`, `.alc.xml`) are stored in the same directory
		- The system skips paths containing `/Backup/` or `/Ableton Project Info/`
		- XML files are regenerated if:
			- The XML file is missing
			- The binary file is newer than the XML file
