# Conventional Commit Messages with Branch Diffs

This rule provides guidance for writing conventional commit messages

## Writing Commit Messages

### 1. Analyze Changes
- Do a diff relative to the main branch and a git status
- Review the diff to understand:
  - Which files were changed
  - What types of changes were made (additions, deletions, modifications)
  - The scope and impact of changes

### 2. Commit Message Structure
Follow the conventional commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Where:
- `type` is one of:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
  - `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `scope` (optional): The part of the codebase affected
- `subject`: Brief description in present tense
- `body` (optional): Detailed explanation
- `footer` (optional): Breaking changes, issue references

### 3. Best Practices
- Use the present tense ("add" not "added")
- Use imperative mood ("move" not "moves")
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Wrap body text at 72 characters
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues/PRs in the footer

### 4. Examples

#### Documentation Update
```
docs: reorganize development and testing documentation

- Create new [[Installation/Dev]] namespace for development setup
- Move development testing docs from [[Dev/Testing/Installation]]
- Update installation guide with clearer development section
- Add testing conventions documentation

This change improves the organization of development-related
documentation and makes it easier for contributors to find
setup and testing information.
```

#### Maintenance Task
```
chore: update pre-commit config to use modern stage names

Migrate from deprecated 'commit' stage to 'pre-commit' stage
using pre-commit migrate-config
```

### 6. Workflow for AI Agents

When working within this repository, AI agents should follow this workflow when making commits:
1. Implement the required changes.
2. Stage specific files with targeted `git add`.
3. Update the project journal with relevant notes.
4. Commit changes using the conventional commit format.
5. Add a commit reference to the journal entry using the `[[git/commit]]` tag.
