# Logseq Journal Update Guidelines

This rule instructs AI agents to record a summary of their actions in the daily Logseq journal page using Logseq Flavored Markdown (LFM).

## 1. Journal Page Location
- The journal page is located at `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/journals/{{YYYY_MM_DD}}.md`
- Use today's date for the page name (e.g., `2025_05_18.md`).

## 2. Entry Structure
- Append under a top-level bullet labeled `[[AI/Actions]]` if present, otherwise create it.
  - Example:
    - `- [[AI/Actions]]`
      - `- [HH:MM] Brief description of action`
- Use `HH:MM` in 24-hour format for timestamps.
- Each entry should be one bullet per action.

## 3. Formatting
- Use TABs for indentation and ensure each line starts with `- `.
- Follow LFM rules: heading depth = indent level (level 0: `- #`, level 1: `- ##`, etc.).
- No blank lines between bullets.

## 4. Content Guidelines
- Summarize the action in past tense or present perfect.
- Mention affected files or significant results if relevant.
- Keep entries concise (one sentence).
