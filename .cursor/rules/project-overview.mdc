## Best Practices for AI Assistance
1. When answering questions about the project:
   - First check if the information exists in the Logseq docs
   - Use standard markdown when referencing docs from outside `ableton-live-git-hooks/`
   - Use LFM only when editing files within `ableton-live-git-hooks/`
2. For documentation edits:
   - Follow the rules in [logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-cursor-rules/logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc)
   - Never modify `tags::` frontmatter in any document
   - Use appropriate markdown style based on location (LFM vs standard)
3. When searching for information:
   - Prefer searching in `ableton-live-git-hooks/pages/` for detailed documentation
   - Use `README.md` for quick reference and project overview
   - Check [About.md](mdc:ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/About.md) for conceptual understanding
