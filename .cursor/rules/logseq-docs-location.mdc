# Logseq Documentation Location and Markdown Usage

## Documentation Location
- The primary documentation for this project is stored in the `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/` directory
- This is a Logseq knowledge garden containing:
  - `pages/` - Main documentation pages
  - `journals/` - Daily notes and progress tracking
  - `logseq/` - Logseq application data

## Markdown Style Guidelines

### Logseq-Flavored Markdown (LFM)
- **Use LFM ONLY within the `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/` directory**
- LFM features include:
  - Block-based structure with TAB indentation
  - Page links using double brackets: `[[Page Name]]`
  - Special frontmatter handling
  - Block references and other Logseq-specific features
- See [logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/logseq-cursor-rules/logseq-flavored-markdown.mdc) for detailed LFM formatting rules

### Standard Markdown
- **Use standard markdown EVERYWHERE ELSE in the repository**
- This includes:
  - `README.md`
  - Any documentation outside `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/`
  - Code comments
  - Issue descriptions
  - Pull request descriptions
- When linking to Logseq pages from outside `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/`, use standard markdown links:
  ```markdown
  [Link Text](mdc:give-care-docs/pages/Page___Name.md)
  ```
- Do not use Logseq-style links (`[[Page Name]]`) outside of `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/`

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Usage
1. In `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/SomePage.md`:
   ```markdown
   - See [[Another Page]] for more details
   - # This is a proper LFM heading
   ```

2. In `README.md`:
   ```markdown
   See [Documentation](mdc:give-care-docs/pages/SomePage.md) for details
   # This is a standard markdown heading
   ```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage
1. In `README.md`:
   ```markdown
   See [[Some Page]] for details  # Wrong: Using LFM links outside ableton-live-git-hooks-docs
   ```

2. In `ableton-live-git-hooks-docs/pages/SomePage.md`:
   ```markdown
   # This heading is wrong (missing bullet point)
   See [Some Page](mdc:give-care-docs/pages/SomePage.md)  # Wrong: Using standard markdown links in LFM
   ```
